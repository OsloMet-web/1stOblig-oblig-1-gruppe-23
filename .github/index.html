    The importance of groupwork

    <h3>
        Three arguments against working in small groups
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Conflicts.</li>
        <p>
            <dd> Conflicts within small groups can lead to complications that makes the group work less efficient,
                therefore delaying agreements and creating uncomfortable atmosphere for other colleagues.</dd>
        </p>

        <li>Unequal workload.</li>
        <p>
            <dd>Having several members in a team that have difference in experiences, skillsets and motivation
                can lead to dividing uneven workload to the group members. Leading to putting more pressure on some
                members
                that may cause their motivation to dwindle.</dd>
        </p>
        <li>Scheduling problems.</li>
        <p>
            <dd>The team members often have different personal lives, problems, distance to the workplace.
                This will result in scheduling problems for the whole team especially if the meeting exceeds the
                scheduled work hours.</dd>
        </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Three arguments in favor of working in small groups
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Diverse perspectives and ideas.</li>
        <p>
            <dd>Small groups often include individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and areas of skill. This
                diversity of perspectives can lead to
                further discussions and innovative solutions. This favor can encourage group members to challenge each
                others assumptions, leading to deeper insights,
                making it easier to approach the problem as a group.</dd>
        </p>

        <li>Collaborative learning and skill sharing.</li>
        <p>
            <dd>
                Sharing of individual skills, knowledge and expertise allows for promotion of
                collaborative learning and skill sharing in a small group setting.
            </dd>
        </p>

        <li>Enhanced motivation.</li>
        <p>
            <dd>
                When individuals work towards the same goal, especially as a small group. It gives a higher level of
                motivation in terms
                of engagement and dedication to perform well to the group's objective.
            </dd>
        </p>
    </ul>
