        <dd> My VGS was beside another highschool and an elementary school in Lier. Therefore seeing a big croud in the morning and afternoon. 
        My most memorable memory from highschool is my hangouts with friends in librabry every recess. The librabian wasn't enjoying it as
        much as we did, but she befriended us after three long years. </dd>

        <dd> My favourite memories from when I attended VGS were made in the cafeteria. 
            They had an amazingly huge variety of foods and beverages with a weekly menu for the warm lunches. 
            I especially remember everyone running to the cafeteria after class to buy cheesy calzones and pizzas, which created insanely large queues.</dd>

       My old VGS was a nice place with good library were i love to be there with my freinds.  
       We also had alot of quit rooms that we can work there in peace and silence. 
       the canteen in my VGS was not the best in the city but still not bad.

    <p><dd>My VGS had open spaces where we could sit in groups and relax or work in the corridors. It was very spacious and made for an amazing collaborative environment</dd></p>

        My VGs was located at the heart of Lillestrøm which made it easy to get to and from. 
        It was spread across two builiding; one old  built with red bricks and other one with a 
        modern touch giving it a beautiful contrast.
